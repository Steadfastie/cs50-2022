# SIMPLE PDF READER
#### Video Demo: bit.ly/3EwmdPi
#### Description:
This is python-based simple pdf-reader with 1 reason to be written: open .pdf files

Project uses Tkinter GUI library

CS50 codespace does not support external libraries and git

In order to run my project, one needs to download everything as 1 folder

Or just clone repo

This PDF reader converts opened files to pictures and puts everything
in fullscreen. User can exit fullscreen with keybind Control-E

During developing this project I've read plenty of documentation and tutorial, e.g. :
--GTK(it all began with C, but I had issues running it on Windows)
--GIT
--Tkinter
--Pillow (PIL)
--Different python libraries developed to work with pdf (they are small each but it summed up to 2 days of research)
--Some OS python features
--EXE

Word 'simple' in the begging of header means that project is primitive
Program can't zoom, smoothscroll, support touchscreen and load big files fast

As this is the last cs50 task I would like to thank cs50 team! 
You did a really great job to cover that much of information in just 2 month of studding
I am now thinking to read Bjarne Stroustrup Programming! The bible of C++
Hope it will be my greatest mistake, but I find it really joyfull to learn programming

Have a nice day!
